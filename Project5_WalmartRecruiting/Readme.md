**Project 5:** Predict Walmart sales 

The Walmart data we use is downloaded from Kaggle. There are 45 stores and 81 departments in this data set. Our goal is to predict the weekly sales in each store under each department. First, we fill missing values in our data set and plot our data to find their patterns. Then, we applied three models including Seasonal Na√Øve Method, Product Method and ARIMA Model to do prediction and evaluate their performance using WMAE.
