**Project 2:** Lending club loan data analysis

Create a model that predicts whether or not a loan will be default using the historical data. The historical loan data we use is downloaded from Kaggle. It contains 887379 records and 74 explanatory variables. In our data preprocessing procedure, we drop some irrelevant variables, dealing with some unusual values, fill missing values, combine levels of categorical variables and dummy coding. Then we apply various advanced models to predict the loan status. After evaluating their performance, we find that xgboot, random forest and ensemble model are robust and well-performed, so we set them as our three prediction methods.
