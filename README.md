**Project 1:** R code to predict the prices for the Iowa Housing Data

The houses prices data used is downloaded from Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques). It contains 1460 recent house sold records and 81 explanatory variables describing (almost) every aspect of these houses. 
The first prediction method used is linear regression with feature selection using AIC and BIC. Then after evaluating the performance of various advanced models applied to predict house sale prices, it is found that XGBoost and ensemble model are robust and well-performed, hence they are used as second and third prediction methods for the sale prices.
